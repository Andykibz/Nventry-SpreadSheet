# Nventry-SpreadSheet
This is an Application that aims to utilise Google Sheets, A Web FrontEnd Framework(Vue3) and an EVM to realise an Inventory Managment System.
There is no backend stack like Flask, Laravel or Django.
The items in the Inventory will be represented as NFTs on the Ledger
The main goal of the Project is not only to Manage Inventory but also to track Invenotry items in an MRO setup.
